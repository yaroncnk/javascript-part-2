# JavaScript part 2: functions and objects

* If you haven’t finished the previous assignment (excluding the challenges part), complete this first.
* Fork this repository and create a new Cloud9 project based on it.

Functions
---------
* Create a file called `functions.js`. Then, do the following:
  * Read about the [`Array.prototype.sort`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) method. Create a function that can be used with `sort`. This function should take two strings, and return a value that sort can use to determine which is the longest string. Finally, create an array of strings and try to get it sorted using your new function.
  * Create an array of objects (don’t need to use `new` here, just regular object literals). These objects will contain a `name` and `email` property. Then, run some code that will sort your array by the longest name. Then, run some code that will sort your array by e-mail address in alphabetical order.
  * Create a function that can be used with [`Array.prototype.map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map). This function should take a number and return its square. Then, use this function with map on an array of numbers to check the result.
  * Create a function that can be used with `Array.prototype.map`. This function should be able to take an object and square its “num” property. Then, use this function with map on an array of objects each containming a “num” property.
  * In a previous workshop, you had to create a function that took two numbers and an operation (add, sub, mult, …) and returned the result of the operation on the two numbers. Here we are going to do the same but at a higher order.
  Create a function called `operationMaker` that takes only a string called `operation` as argument. This string could be `“add”`, `“subtract”`, `“mult”` or `“div”`. Your function will **return a function** that will take two numbers and return the result of running operation on these numbers.
  The end result should let me do something like this:
    ```javascript
var adder = operationMaker(“add”);
var sum = adder(5, 10); //15

var mult = operationMaker(“mult”);
var product = mult(5, 10); // 50
```

* Once you are finished, commit and push your changes. Then, create a pull request so we can start checking your work.

Objects
-------

## Warriors!
* Create a file called `warriors.js`, then, do the following. Commit and push as often as you like so that we can monitor the progress of your code in the pull request.
  * Create a constructor function called `Warrior` that can create new warriors. This function will take parameters `name`, and `gender`. `name` can be any string, `gender` can be `M` or `F`. It should create a warrior that has these properties:
    * `name`: the value that was passed to the constructor
    * `gender`: the value that was passed to the constructor
    * `level`: 1
    * `weapon`: wooden sword
    * `power`: a random number between 1 and 100
  * In addition to that, every object that gets created should have the following methods:
    * `fight`: will output to the console: "<name> rushes to the arena with <his/her> <weapon>"
    * `faceoff`: faceoff takes one argument called `opponent`. Based on the `power` of each opponent, this method should output to the console which player won the fight based on their power. Be as creative as you like with the text of this method :)
  * Finally, create a bunch of warriors and make them fight together.

## Address book
* Create a file called `addressbook.js`, then do the following. Commit and push as often as you like so that we can monitor the progress of your work in the pull request.
  * Create a constructor function called `Person` that can create new persons. It takes `firstName` and `lastName` as arguments, and assigns them to the new object. In addition to that, the constructor function will assign each person an `emails` property that will be an empty array.
  * Create a constructor function called `Email` that can create a new email address. It takes `address` and `type` as arguments. It will assign `address` to the new object. For `type`, check if it's in the list (work, home, other). If it's not in the list, set the type to "other".
  * Add an `addEmail` function to the *prototype of `Person`*. This function will be available to all objects created using `new Person`. The `addEmail` function should take an email address and type as arguments, call the `Email` constructor to create a new email object, then *`push`* that email object to the `emails` of the person.
  * Finally test your code by creating a person and giving them a home and work email.

## Maps and tiles
* Create a file called `map.js`, then, do the following. Commit and push as often as you like so that we can monitor the progress of your code in the pull request.

In this exercise, we're going to create a constructor for maps in a 2D game. A `Map` is an array of arrays of `Tile` objects. A `Tile` object represents one square in the map. It only has a `type` property which will determine if it's water, grass or sand. The `Map` object will have `width` and `height` properties, and its constructor will generate width * height `Tile` objects.

To do this exercise, let's follow these steps:

  * Create a constructor function called `Tile` that can create new tiles for our map. This function will take parameter `type` and create an object that has these properties:
    * `type`: whatever was passed to the `Tile` constructor function
  * The `Tile` objects should also have a method called `isWalkable`. This method should, using `this.type`, return `true` or `false` depending on whether the tile can be walked on. The function should return `true` if the type is "grass" or "sand". The function should return `false` if the type is anything else.
  * Create a constructor function called `Map` that will generate a map. This function will take parameters `width` and `height` and create a map object with these properties:
    * `width`: whatever was passed to the `Map` constructor function (should be an integer value)
    * `height`: whatever was passed to the `Map` constructor function (should be an integer value)
    * `tiles`: this property should be created as a 2D array of `Tile` objects *inside the constructor*. Using two nested `for` loops bound by `width` and `height` respectively, create `new Tile` objects and give them a **random** value for the `type`, between "grass", "sand" and "water".
  * The `Map` objects should also have two methods on them:
    * `getWalkableOutput`: this method should iterate over the `this.tiles` 2D array, and output in the console a rectangle representing the "walkability" of the map. For walkable tiles, use an `O`, and for unwalkable tiles use an `X`. For example, your output could look something like this for a 4x4 map:

    ```
    OOOO
    OXXO
    OOXO
    OOOO
    ```

    * `getAsciiOutput`: this method should iterate over the `this.tiles` 2D array and output in the console a rectangle representing the disposition of the map. For grass tiles, use a `*`, for sand tiles use a `:` and for water use a `~` symbol. For example, your output could look something like this for the same 4x4 map as above:

    ```
    ****
    *~~*
    **~*
    ::::
    ```

    * `spawnWarrior` (**challenge**): using the `Warrior` constructor that you created in the above exercise, create a method `spawnWarrior` that takes a warrior object and a `x` and `y` position. This method of the `Map` should take the warrior object and associate it to the appropriate `Tile`.

# Challenge!
As we saw in class, Object-Oriented Programming is supposed to give us a systematic way to **encapsulate** functionality. The two previous exercises don't explore this concept fully. For this challenge, we will be building a **queue**. A queue is a data structure where items can be pushed to the end, and only taken from the beginning. It's commonly referred to as FIFO or First In, First Out. It mimicks the real-life queues that you would have at a concert or airport.

In class, we saw that a queue can be easily created in JavaScript using an array. By forcing ourselves to use only the `push` and `shift` methods of arrays, we can easily create a queue. However, if we limit ourselves to using an array, then we can "cheat" the system and start calling other methods like `pop`, `unshift` or `splice` to cheat our way out of the queue system.

For this exercise, we want to build a queue using OOP principles, and encapsulate the array inside the queue so that it cannot be accessed directly. Then, we will provide each queue with its own `push` and `shift` methods that will delegate to the array.

Here's one naïve way to create our queue system:

```javascript
function Queue() {
  this.arr = []; // this array should never be touched directly!!
}

Queue.prototype.push = function(item) { this.arr.push(item); };
Queue.prototype.shift = function() {return this.arr.shift(); };
```

Then, we can use our `Queue` class to create new queues!

```javascript
var benAndJerrysQueue = new Queue();

// two people come in the store!
benAndJerrysQueue.push("person1");
benAndJerrysQueue.push("person2");

// one person is ready to be served!
var nextPerson = benAndJerrysQueue.shift(); // person1

//.....
```

This is great, except there's one flaw in our system. Each queue has a property called `arr` which lets us access the queue directly. With the previous example, we can still cheat by doing `benAndJerrysQueue.arr.unshift("person3")` and therefore adding a person at the beginning of the queue!

Ideally, what we would want is for the array driving our queue to be hidden, **encapsulated** inside the data structure and not accessible from the outside.

Your challenge is to find a way to do this. **Refactor** the code above to make it impossible for someone to access the array that is backing the queue. By refactor, we mean that the Queue should behave exactly the same way, and any code written to use the Queue appropriately should still work.

Hint: You will probably not be able to keep the methods inside the prototype.
Hint 2: Your constructor for `Queue` will have to be reworked. Everything will happen in there.
Hint 3: The array will NOT be inside the object, and will not be in its prototype.

Good luck :)
